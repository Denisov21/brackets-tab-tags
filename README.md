## Tab tags

A [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) extension to add a `\n` and `\t` between HTML or XML tags, like Aptana Studio 3 does it.

### How To Use
Simply type, and if your cursor is between `<tag>|</tag>` (`|` is the cursor) and you press `ENTER`, it will be converted to
```html
<tag>
    |
</tag>
```
